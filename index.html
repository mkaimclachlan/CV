  <p>Jack of all trades but master of none. Looking forward to the year of 2021 as a year of change, growth, and learning.
     Will be focusing the majority of time and efforts on becoming a experienced web developer and cyber security specialist,
     as these professions will help me fulfill my goals whilst also being incredibly fun.

     My focus will be on working as a freelance developer and/or security consultant and make my money without having to compromise
     my freedoms. If freelance doesn't work out or turns out to be less than ideal, I'll aim to work for a company that aligns with my
     interests or pays enough to forgo those interests temporarily. At the end of the day it all comes down to doing what I have to <!DOCTYPE html>
     to do what I want to do. For me, what I want to do is change the world even if it's just a miniscule difference.</p>
